## Welcome to My GitHub Page

Written entirely in Markdown, this page was created for a software engineering project course at the University I attend! My name is Viren Abhyankar, and I am a computer science student at UC San Diego.

The following is a list of things I have to add to this site:
- [] Pictures
- [] Links
- [] Headings
- [] Styling text
- [] Quoting text
- [] Quoting code
- [] Links
- [] Section links
- [] Relative links
- [] Lists
- [x] Task lists
- [] Tables
- [] Embedding Images
- [] Embedding HTML

Looks like I already have a task list!

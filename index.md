## Welcome to My GitHub Page

Written entirely in Markdown, this page was created for a software engineering project course at the University I attend! My name is Viren Abhyankar, and I am a computer science student at UC San Diego.

The following is a list of things I have to add to this site:
- [ ] Pictures
- [ ] Links
- [ ] Headings
- [ ] Styling text
- [ ] Quoting text
- [ ] Quoting code
- [ ] Links
- [ ] Section links
- [ ] Relative links
- [ ] Lists
- [x] Task lists
- [ ] Tables
- [ ] Embedding Images
- [ ] Embedding HTML

Looks like I already have a task list!

Let's start with **Headings**

### Headings

I'm actually going to use headings throughout this page, so there's no need to devote an entire section to just talk about headings. There is a pretty important head*line* today, however. The Democrats have [flipped the US Senate](https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-senate-runoff-election-results-democrats-regain-control-2020-10), and President-elect Joe Biden's victory has been certified by Congress!

Raphael Warnock had this to say after he defeated Republican candidate Kelly Loeffler:

> The other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator.

Pretty powerful stuff. Here's a picture of his mom!
